messing around with 

Docker, Rx.NET, RabbitMQ

basic simulation of streaming spot index prices from exchange through RabbitMQ / Kaffka. Calculation of theoretical futures price based on index spot price and cost of carry on client side. all made it up numbers & data but the idea is to handle message queue streams using observables.
